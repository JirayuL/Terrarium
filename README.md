## Introduction
Today, even a small convenience store has so many kind of items in their stock for them to manage. And things get even worse for a local wholesale business, of which in their stock might be up to a thousand kinds of goods. The traditional paper-based solution are clumsy and error prone, so we think maybe itâ€™s the time for a computer-based solution for this kind of business. We expect this solution to ease the wholesale business in managing their stock and keeping track of the price of each item.

This project is made for `Wannasit` store. `Wannasit` store is my friend's family's store located in `Suphanburi` Province. One day he ask me how to create a program for his family's store so instead of teach him I will do it for him.
