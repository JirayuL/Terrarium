# Terrarium

## Introduction

Today, even a small convenience store has so many kind of items in their stock for them to manage. And things get even worse for a wholesale business, of which in their stock might be up to a thousand kinds of goods. The traditional paper-based solution are clumsy and error prone, so we think maybe it's the time for a computer-based solution for the of business. We expect this solution to help the wholesale business in managing their stock and keeping track of the price of each item.

This project was inspired by the **Wannasit** store. **Wannasit** store is my friend's wholesale and retail store located in the *Suphanburi* Province. In the past, he used to ask me about creating a program for managing his family's store, so instead of teaching him I create one, will do it for him.
